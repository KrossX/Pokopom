Description and information
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pokopom is an imput plugin that supports many emulators like PCSX, PCSX2, PJ64,
nullDC, Chankast, etc. Started as a XInput only plugin for X360 controllers, but
now it supports linux too (also for X360 controllers) though GUI less. Supports
rumble, though it depends on emulator/device.

DualShock3 are supported on Windows by using Scarlet.Crush's driver:

Also for ePSXe, Shark would be needed:
